# DFS assignment
# Data Structure implementation
#NOTE Almost all Singly LinkedList's functions are implemented in functions.h 


All these programs run perfectly if compiled with `gcc` compiler.

In case, you wanna run this programs in TURBOC IDE then just make the following changes

1. Find the statement `int main()` and change it to `void main()`

2. Find the statement `return 0;` and change it to `getch();`

3. If the preprocessor directive `#include<conio.h>` isn't included then please include it, it will required for clearing the console screen. For that call `clrscr();` function from the main function.
